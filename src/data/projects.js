      'The packaging design pays tribute to the women of Bergasa, La Rioja, known as "Las Chiguitas," who harvested the vines in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. Despite being left alone in the fields, these women were responsible for cultivating the vines in a natural way to ensure their growth and self-preservation.\nThis label design draws on the rich history of these women, and is based on a collage composition of photographs from 1909, taken from my own family archives. Through this nostalgic nod to the past, the design brings a touch of the past into the present, celebrating the bravery and resilience of these women.',

      "The cover design of this magazine serves as a visual representation of the cultural shift towards a 'new male gaze', characterized by the rejection of traditional gender norms and the embrace of individuality. The bold and striking nature of the design, combined with its message of self-expression, is accentuated by the use of a bold typography. The use of a bold typeface adds emphasis to the central message of the design and further emphasizes the defiance of traditional gender norms.\nThe cover design aims to spark a conversation about the evolving norms of masculinity. For example, the use of makeup, traditionally associated with femininity, and non-binary clothing, deviating from traditional masculine attire, serves to subvert dominant cultural norms and expectations surrounding masculinity. In doing so, the cover design serves as a catalyst for change and promotes a more inclusive and accepting society.",

    description:
      "This project explores the objectification of women in Western society through the creation of four visual artifacts. Each artifact represents a distinct form of objectification, emphasizing the need for critical examination and societal transformation. The multifunctional fitment embodies the myth of the perfect woman, reflecting the pressure on women to fulfill multiple roles simultaneously. The double-sided glass symbolizes the eroticization of the female body in commercial packaging. A vase of flowers challenges the mistreatment of the female sexual organ, presenting it as a divine and sacred symbol of empowerment. Lastly, a porcelain tea service with a printed pornographic image confronts societal norms, highlighting the devaluation of the female body. Through these visual representations, the project aims to foster dialogue, provoke critical thought, and raise awareness about the consequences of objectifying women. It calls for a reevaluation of societal attitudes and behaviors, emphasizing empowerment, equality, and a departure from the objectification of women.",

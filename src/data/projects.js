      'The packaging design pays tribute to the women of Bergasa, La Rioja, known as "Las Chiguitas,"\n who harvested the vines in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. Despite being left alone in the\nfields, these women were responsible for cultivating the vines in a natural way to ensure their\ngrowth and self-preservation.\nThis label design draws on the rich history of these women, and is based on a collage composition\nof photographs from 1909, taken from my own family archives.\nThrough this nostalgic nod to the past, the design brings a touch of the past into the present,\n celebrating the bravery and resilience of these women.',
